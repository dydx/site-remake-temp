# site-remake-temp
working on a redesign of my website, as well as putting my money where my mouth is and making this thing as fast as possible

# methodologies
how do we make things fast? by being smart and knowing when and where we can optmize

- async script loading
- async CSS loading
- critical path of above the fold content
- caching assets (in browser and localStorage)

And more generally, making the absolute most of TCP Slow Start and the APIs afforded to us from our browser vendors

# why?
Because, I kinda want to do this. I'm also trying to work out a workshop for showing these tools and methodologies to developers in my area to help set a new standard of performance in local business websites made by our design agencies (because right now, they're abysmally depressingly slow).
